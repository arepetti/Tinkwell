# Getting Started with Tinkwell

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough to get a basic Tinkwell instance up and running.

## 1. Generate the Development Certificate

Before running the Supervisor, you need a valid HTTPS certificate. If you have a valid PFX certificate then set its path in `TINKWELL_CERT_PATH` and its password in `TINKWELL_CERT_PASS`. If you do not have one or you want to start experimenting/developing using a self-signed certificate then follow these instructions.

### Windows

Go the application folder and run:

```bash
./tw certs create
./tw certs install
```

If you're working with a machine without Tinkwell then you can use the script `Development/Create-DevCert.ps1` and then set the environment variables manually. 

### Linux

* Create the certificate using `tw` (alternatively you could use the script `Development/create-dev-cert.sh`, be sure to update to change file names as appropriate):
    ```bash
    ./tw certs create --export-name=tinkwell
    ```

* Add these lines to the bottom of your shell profile script (e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
    ```bash
    export TINKWELL_CERT_PATH="/absolute/path/to/tinkwell.pfx"
    export TINKWELL_CERT_PASS="your-password-here"
    ```

#### Debian (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc)

```bash
sudo cp ./tinkwell-cert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/tinkwell-cert.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

#### Red Hat (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora)

```bash
sudo cp ./tinkwell-cert.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/tinkwell-cert.crt
sudo update-ca-trust extract
```

#### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo cp ./tinkwell-cert.pem /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/tinkwell-cert.crt
sudo update-ca-trust extract
```

Alternatively:

```bash
mv ./tinkwell-cert.pem ./tinkwell-cert.crt
sudo trust anchor --store ./tinkwell-cert.crt
```

## 2. Understand the Ensemble Configuration

The `ensamble.tw` file is the heart of your application's configuration, defining all the processes (runners) that the Supervisor will manage.

-   Review the [Ensemble Syntax documentation](./Ensamble.md) to understand how runners and firmlets are defined.
-   Open the default `ensamble.tw` file (in the `Assets` project if in VS or the output folder if in "production") to see a practical example.

## 3. Start the Supervisor

The Supervisor is the main entry point of your application.

-   Launch the `Tinkwell.Supervisor` project from your deployment directory (or Visual Studio if you're in development mode).
-   The Supervisor will read the `ensamble.tw` file and start all the configured runners.

## 4. Verify the System

Once the Supervisor is running, you can use the command-line interface (CLI) to inspect the system. Check the console log for errors then type these commands:

```bash
# If you changed the configuration manually then check if  it's correct:
./tw ensamble lint ./ensamble.tw
./tw measures lint ./config/measures.twm

# Check that all the basic runners are correctly loaded
./tw runners list

# Check that all the gRPC services are correctly registered
./tw contracts list

# Check that the measures you defined are present
./tw measures list --values

# Check that events gateway is running correctly, the next
# line must be executed in a separate terminal
./tw events subscribe test

# Back in the original terminal you publish a test event
./tw events publish test user created test

# If you have alarms on some measures you can simulate them:
./tw measures write my-temperature "30 Â°C"

# Check that resource usage is reasonable
./tw runners profile
```
