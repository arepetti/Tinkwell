This repository is a work in progress and serves as an exploratory reference implementation for the IoT hub described in [IoT Architectures Under Pressure](https://dev.to/adriano-repetti/iot-architectures-under-pressure-why-implementation-isnt-as-simple-as-it-seems-part-1-3inn).

At this stage, the code is intended solely for **experimentation** with technical solutions: it is not production-ready, and both its structure and content may (should!) change drastically at any time.
